<li>I think I miss clicked on this question. I remember discussing with my friends about this question and I remember bringing up the fact that it says <em>each</em> packet contains blah blah blah. This is too extreme of an answer and I don't think that every single data sent through the internet is encrypted, as it would use up too much resources. I think I just miss clicked. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Question-20:">Question 20:<a class="anchor-link" href="#Question-20:"> </a></h3><ul>
<li>I am still not too sure about the reasoning behind this question. I think I am too sleep deprived to think deeply about this question. I will probably get some sleep and then take another look at this.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Question-37:">Question 37:<a class="anchor-link" href="#Question-37:"> </a></h3><ul>
<li>This question is regarding the big O notation. I am still unsure about the big o notation, so I don't understand the explantion on why this is the answer. I will take a loot at the 3.17 videos on this topic. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Question-49:">Question 49:<a class="anchor-link" href="#Question-49:"> </a></h3><ul>
<li>For this question the list part got me. I didn't notice that the question said that the first element in the index has a non-student score. </li>

<h1 id="What-I-can-do-better:">What I can do better:<a class="anchor-link" href="#What-I-can-do-better:"> </a></h1><p>I think that I struggle taking in all the details of a question. Because of this I am prone to making silly mistakes that can cost me some decent amount of points. I will try to read the question more carefully and try to understand the question better.</p>
