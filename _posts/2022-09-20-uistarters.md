<p>Collegeboard criteria requirements:</p>

<pre><code>Row 1: Program Purpose and Function
Our program’s purpose is to provide an automated organizer for students’ tasks. The function is to utilize a calendar and allow students to add, remove, and edit events on each day. Students will also be able to sign in with their own account in order to save their events.

Row 2: Data Abstraction
The data will be a list which includes a students’ events. As a student adds, removes, or edits an event, the list will change. The name of the variable representing the list will be calendarEvent, or some variable related to events on a calendar.

Row 3: Managing Complexity
We can manage the complexity by creating a new list specific to each user. Then, we can create a list of all the users, making the entire project easy to manage.

Row 4: Procedural Abstraction
My student-developed procedure is to make the login screen for the website. I will also help to log all of the information entered by the users when they first use the scheduler.

Row 5: Algorithm Implementation
While we have not started on the project yet, our plan is to make a list inside of a list, etc. The list can be appended by using a while loop.

Row 6: Testing
After making slight changes, I will test the code by using a local server. I will do it very often in order to make sure that everything is working before I move onto a new task.</code></pre>
