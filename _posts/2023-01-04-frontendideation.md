<h2 id="Frontend-ideation:">Frontend ideation:<a class="anchor-link" href="#Frontend-ideation:"> </a></h2><p>We plan on making a convienient exercise tracker web-app. We will do this by implementing wearable integration, user personalization, goal setting, weather-based activity suggestions, meal planning, and exercise tracking.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Wearable integration: We will integrate fitness watches from fitbit, apple, and samsung. This will most likely be done through an API. I am incharge of the frontend therefore I will have the interactive features to code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>user personalization: This will include exercise suggestions based on the users height, weight, BMI, age, and gender.</p>
</li>
<li><p>goal setting: This will include the user to prompt realistic goals for themselves in order to improve</p>
</li>
<li><p>Weather-based activity suggestions: This will be made through a weather api. For example, if the weather api sends the data back to the caller and the data says that today will be a rainy day, then the suggestion will be to do a home workout.</p>
</li>
<li><p>meal planning: based on the users personalized data. User will be categorized into bulk, cut, or maingain and will be given the meal suggestions based on this.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Exercise tracking: This will track the users exercise activity. It will have a database of a lot of exercises and their average calories burned/min, and other info.</p>
</li>
</ul>
