<h1 id="So...-How-far-did-we-get?">So... How far did we get?<a class="anchor-link" href="#So...-How-far-did-we-get?"> </a></h1><p>Well, we did make a general plan for our website. Instead of normal, boring old css, we will be using SASS. I thought this would have been a useless little coding thing, but the more I use it, the more I start to love it. So far we have used the import function to import a font, mixin to create a function with display flex that aligns items and justfiies content to center. I have also used variables to set some of the base colors of the website. For the html: I have a very crude navbar. It will get better each day, well, my plan is to finish it by tuesday.</p>
