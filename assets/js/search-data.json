In this data example, we are going to make &quot;the best computer jokes ever ;)&quot; and serve them over the Internet. The ultimate objective is to allow our viewers to provide a like or dislike on each of our jokes. . This code planning begins by coming up with some jokes and defining a data &quot;model&quot; to keep and manage the jokes. . jokes_data contains a list of dictionary records containing joke and reactions:haha or boohoo - joke_list contains collection of jokes we will put into jokes_data | . | Next comes some functions to interact with our jokes . def initJokes(): initializes jokes_data | def getJokes(): returns the complete list of jokes | def getJoke(): returns a single joke from our list | ... many more function can be examined by reading comments below ... | . | . import random jokes_data = [] joke_list = [ &quot;If you give someone a program... you will frustrate them for a day; if you teach them how to program... you will &quot; &quot;frustrate them for a lifetime.&quot;, &quot;Q: Why did I divide sin by tan?

Backend Interface for Web API (Control) . An application programming interface (API) is the medium by which different systems of software interact. In our applications we have two big systems:1. Python Backend that stores data beyond a single Web page2. GH Pages/Fastpages Frontend that is responsible for presenting data . To communicate data between Frontend and Backend, this section Backend code provides and interface to the Frontend using a Web Service Endpoint. Examples of endpoints are listed below and can be typed within a browser, which will return JSON data: . https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/2 | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/random | . As you can see, these Endpoints return JSON. They are NOT that readable by normal humans. However, they are very effective in passing requested data across the Internet. The Frontend code is responsible for formatting and presenting and interface that allows the typical computer user to interact with this data. . The next cell of code is Creating Endpoints that return JSON. This allows developers in the Frontend to interact with Backend data. API is a contract between the Frontend and Backend on how to share data. . FYI, there is NO output from this section . . from flask import Blueprint, jsonify # jsonify creates an endpoint response object from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building import requests # used for testing import random # Blueprints allow this code to be procedurally abstracted from main.py, meaning code is not all in one place app_api = Blueprint(&#39;api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/jokes&#39;) # endpoint prefix avoid redundantly typing /api/jokes over and over # API generator https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#id1 api = Api(app_api) class JokesAPI: # not implemented, this would be where we would allow creation of a new Joke class _Create(Resource): def post(self, joke): pass # getJokes() class _Read(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getJokes()) # getJoke(id) class _ReadID(Resource): def get(self, id): return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadRandom(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getRandomJoke()) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadCount(Resource): def get(self): count = countJokes() countMsg = {&#39;count&#39;: count} return jsonify(countMsg) # put method: addJokeHaHa class _UpdateLike(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeHaHa(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # put method: addJokeBooHoo class _UpdateJeer(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeBooHoo(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # building RESTapi interfaces, these routes are added to Web Server http://&lt;server&lt;/api/jokes api.add_resource(_Create, &#39;/create/&lt;string:joke&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_Read, &#39;/&#39;) # default, which returns all jokes api.add_resource(_ReadID, &#39;/&lt;int:id&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadRandom, &#39;/random&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadCount, &#39;/count&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateLike, &#39;/like/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateJeer, &#39;/jeer/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) . Frontend (View Simulation) and Hacks . This python codes tests endpoints on a server. This can be handy for development and testing when making modifications to the Jokes Web APIs.

Since I made the initial repository, I am pretty sure that I had created a .gitignore. I will check and if it turns out that I didn&#39;t make it properly, then I will go back and update it. . Do you have a requirements.txt file to manage dependencies introduced to your Code Base? . Yes, we do have a requirements.txt that we installed through the &quot;pip3 install -r requirements.txt&quot; command . Have you established Issues as part of your Development process? . Our team has been a little slow with the project because of a lot of technical difficulties. We haven&#39;t established issues as a part of our development process, but we have discussed about it. We will make use of that github feature shortly. . Have you considered making Pull Requests to track development? Have you considered forks or branching techniques with pull requests? . Again, our team has experienced a lot of issues so far and it was difficult for us to get back on track after so many. We have also discussed about these things and we will make use of them shortly. We are currently prioritizing research above the small details. . Are you managing Issues on a Project Board/Scrum Board like Kanban? . Yes. We are currently managing all of our progress through the scrumboard. We used the Kanban template to create our scrum board, so yes. .",

We have already gone through the brainstorming stage and decided on what we are going to be doing for the PBL final project. . Are we considering a project that is best for our educational purpose? . We decided on making a scheduling app that gets data from canvas and uses it to create a schedule. I think this is a good idea with regards to an educational purpose. . Is the project going to hold team members interest for 8 weeks? . All our group members talked about actually using the end result of the project in their daily lives. Considering the convinience of the app we will be designing, I think that we will be motivated enough to get through the 8 weeks. . Does the project have potential for someone to use it beyond the 8 weeks? ie Customer or Sponsor needed? . Since Canvas is used by many institutions and schools, I think that this will definetly be useful for people outside of the 8 week period. . Does the project have potential to be used for Create Performance Task submission? . After reading through the create performance task task, I decided that this would be a good match for it. It fulfills all the requirements. .",

            "content": "My partner, Alan, and I have decided on making a math quiz on applab for the week 4 requirement. We plan on using basic math questions to test out applabs developer tool. We will use the given code blocks and experiment around to find the proper layout for the quiz we want. We plan on giving basic feedback if the user gets a question wrong and uplifting messages when they get it right. We also plan to troll people by telling them that they are guaranteed a 0% on their next math test. It is what it is. Update: While creating I noticed that there were a lot of blocks which I didn&#39;t understand. I watched a few youtube videos and implemented some of the blocks to make my app a little bit more interesting. Update 2: After finishing, I realized that onEvent was a very frequently used command. So was the IF controller. I&#39;m exicited to see how we will be developing apps outside of applab. . Purpose: The purpose of this short math quiz is for us, the developers, to have a brief introduction to developing. There is no particular purpose for the user except entertainment. . Data abstraction: I figured out how to get input from a user and how I can implement that into the quiz. . Managing complexity: I organized the code and made it easier to understand by improving the syntax and making notes. . Testing: I self-tested the quiz to eliminate possible errors. I wasn&#39;t able to figure out how to eliminate some of the errors, but I was able to eliminate most minor errors. . For the create task project, my idea is making an app that asks a bunch of analysis questions and based on the responses gives you a personality. In short, my idea is making a personality quiz. .
