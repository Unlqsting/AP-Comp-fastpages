    "We plan on making a convienient exercise tracker web-app. We will do this by implementing wearable integration, user personalization, goal setting, weather-based activity suggestions, meal planning, and exercise tracking. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Wearable integration: We will integrate fitness watches from fitbit, apple, and samsung. This will most likely be done through an API. I am incharge of the frontend therefore I will have the interactive features to code. \n",
    "\n",
    "- user personalization: This will include exercise suggestions based on the users height, weight, BMI, age, and gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "- goal setting: This will include the user to prompt realistic goals for themselves in order to improve\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weather-based activity suggestions: This will be made through a weather api. For example, if the weather api sends the data back to the caller and the data says that today will be a rainy day, then the suggestion will be to do a home workout. \n",
    "\n",
    "- meal planning: based on the users personalized data. User will be categorized into bulk, cut, or maingain and will be given the meal suggestions based on this. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Exercise tracking: This will track the users exercise activity. It will have a database of a lot of exercises and their average calories burned/min, and other info. \n"
