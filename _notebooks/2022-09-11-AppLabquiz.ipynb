    "My partner, Alan, and I have decided on making a math quiz on applab for the week 4 requirement. We plan on using basic math questions to test out applabs developer tool. We will use the given code blocks and experiment around to find the proper layout for the quiz we want. We plan on giving basic feedback if the user gets a question wrong and uplifting messages when they get it right. We also plan to troll people by telling them that they are guaranteed a 0% on their next math test. It is what it is.\n",
    "    Update: While creating I noticed that there were a lot of blocks which I didn't understand. I watched a few youtube videos and implemented some of the blocks to make my app a little bit more interesting. \n",
    "    Update 2: After finishing, I realized that onEvent was a very frequently used command. So was the IF controller. I'm exicited to see how we will be developing apps outside of applab. "
