I do, however, need to remove some things that are common between all the students that used the leuckreunion repository. Things like the backend and swithcing from markdown to html pages would be necessary. I am most likely going to spend spring break doing the write-up, making the video, and revising the write-up. "

The current sub-lesson that I am working on is setting up github pages. I am planning on making use of HTML Divs and creating an aesthetically pleasing lesson that also serves to be educational. This lesson is pretty straightforward. I will have boxes set up that the user can click based on their scenario and be guided through setting up github pages."
