    "We started out with a simple model of a calendar. We then upgraded its looks and functionality by making it bigger, adding theme colors, and integrating events. We also made this a month focused calendar. We then made a weather app next to our calendar for our desired purpose of convinience. It has full weather display functionality using city name as a parameter. During the last stages of our project, we made the events be able to display. For a more detailed progress report, check our scrum board."
