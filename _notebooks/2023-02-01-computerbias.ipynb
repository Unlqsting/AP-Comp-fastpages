    "_Reflection of the exercises done in class_:\n",
    "Basically, we talked about biases in virtual assistants, companies, and computers. We also talked about if these biases are purposeful or unintentional. We then talked about how the companies could benefit from that. \n",
    "My thoughts about this discussion is that it helped me understand computer bias a little better. I have been working on independent machine learning/deep learning projects, so it is important that the machine learning algorithm uses datasets that take in consideration of forgetful things. \n",
    "\n",
    "_**Currently, my code and design for the login system is very biased towards people with no disabilities. This was just because I didn't take that into consideration. After designing and coding the biased version of my code, I will focus on making it more accessible for people with disabilities. I want to make sure that I have the feature working before I get ahead of myself.**_"

    "# Hacks for 5.4 Crowd sourcing\n",
    "**One idea for crowdsourcing is surveying the 150 csp students for their opinion on the collegeboard MCQ tests and whether it helps them prepare for the AP exam or not. We could initiate it by just putting up a QR code of a google form and then we can take in that data and analyze it. We could also sell that data to collegeboard so that they could improve**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Del norte is a pretty large school. We could survey the school on what exercises they most frequently do at the gym. THis would allow our project to only collect data on the most frequently done exercises. THis would save us a lot of time. Yes this would make our project better since we have more 'wanted' exercises. Again, this would save us time.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**We could capture user recommendations. This would allow us to improve upon our website. Some students could even point out criteria that does not meet the collegeboard criteria and this would allow us to refine our project and get a higher grade. We can also write an algorithm to track what people click and what pages they click to. This would allow us to compile an analytics page where we can display what features are most used by users.**"

Companies can use algorithms to target a specific audience and the algorithms can lower the attention span of the users. We can see this is in more data done in scientific research. "

    "#### Why do virtual assistants have female voices? \n",
    "I would say that they have female voices mainly because females are more agreeable and submissive. This is why they are more likely to be used in virtual assistants. This, however, doesn't mean that all voice assistants have female voices. Microsoft has a accessibility setting where you can turn on voice assistance and there are options to pick a male voice assistant. "

These data sets are used for machine learning since you can train a computer to analyze datasets and make predictions based on the datasets. I also saw that there is a usability meter. Each dataset has a usability score out of 10. The higher the score, the greater the usability. "
