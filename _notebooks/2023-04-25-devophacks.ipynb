    "\n",
    "- AWS uses cloud computing to allow the user to connect to a remote server and use it as if it were their own computer. This allows the user to run programs and store data on the server. The user can also access the server from anywhere with an internet connection. This is useful for projects because it allows the user to run programs that require a lot of processing power without having to buy a powerful computer. It also allows the user to store large amounts of data without having to buy a large hard drive.\n",
