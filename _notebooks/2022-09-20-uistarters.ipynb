    "    Row 5: Algorithm Implementation\n",
    "    While we have not started on the project yet, our plan is to make a list inside of a list, etc. The list can be appended by using a while loop.\n",

    "    After making slight changes, I will test the code by using a local server. I will do it very often in order to make sure that everything is working before I move onto a new task."
